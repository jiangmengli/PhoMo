"molecule_oriented" refers to a molecular non-repetitive data set; "experiment_oriented" refers to an experimental molecular repetitive data set.

All experimental data files are in csv format. In addition, there is a backup file called "PC_experiment_json.json" and a description file of the experimental data "PC_experiment.csv" called "PC_experiment_description.txt".

PC_edge.csv is the edge connection information.
PC_edge_feat.csv is the edge feature information. Note: the first column is the edge category number automatically generated by the program (optional).
PC_edge_feat_detail.csv is some specific description information of the edge (including what the specific circle is and the bond angle information).
PC_node_feature.csv is the feature information of each atom. Note: the last column is the average bond angle information automatically identified by the program (optional).
PC_num_edge_list.csv is the number of edges for each molecule.
PC_num_node_list.csv is the number of atoms for each molecule.
PC_experiment.csv is the information of each experimental data (except the molecular graph). For detailed attribute description, see "PC_experiment_description.txt".

The edges and atoms of all molecules are arranged according to the edges of the same molecule, and the atoms are arranged adjacently, and then different molecules are arranged one by one in order.
